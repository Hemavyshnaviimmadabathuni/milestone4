    <p style="font-size:20px;"><b><i>Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is an Indian multinational information technology (IT)
            services and consulting
            company with its headquarters in Mumbai.[6][7] It is a part of the Tata Group and operates in 149 locations
            across 46 countries.[8] In July 2022, it was reported that TCS had crossed 6 lakh or 600,000 Employees
            worldwide. [9]

            TCS is the second largest Indian company by market capitalisation and is among the most valuable IT service
            brands worldwide.[10][11][12] In 2015, TCS was ranked 64th overall in the Forbes "World's Most Innovative
            Companies" ranking, making it one of the highest-ranked IT services companies and a top Indian company.[13]
            As
            of 2018, it is ranked eleventh on the Fortune India 500 list.[14] In April 2018, TCS became the first Indian
            IT
            company to reach $100 billion in market capitalisation[15] and the second Indian company ever (Reliance
            Industries achieved it in 2007)[16] after its market capitalisation stood at ₹6.793 trillion (equivalent to
            ₹7.7
            trillion or US$100 billion in 2020) on the Bombay Stock Exchange.[17][18][19]

            In 2016–2017, parent company Tata Sons owned 72.05% of TCS[20] and more than 70% of Tata Sons' dividends
            were
            generated by TCS.[21] In March 2018, Tata Sons sold stocks of TCS worth $1.25 billion in a bulk deal.[22] As
            of
            15 September 2021, TCS has recorded a market capitalisation of US$200 billion, making it the first Indian IT
            firm to do so.[23]</b></p></i><br>
    <p style="font-size:20px;"><b><i>TCS is one of the largest private-sector employers in India,[118] and the fourth-largest employer among listed
        Indian companies (after Indian Railways, Indian Army, and India Post).[119] TCS has crossed more than 500,000
        employees as of 8 July 2021.[120][121][122][123][124] The number of non-Indian nationals was 21,282 as of 31
        March 2013 (7.7%).[120][125] The employee costs for the FY 2012–13 were US$4.38 billion, which was approx. 38%
        of the total revenue of the company for that period.[126] In the fiscal year 2012–13, TCS recruited a total of
        69,728 new staff, of whom 59,276 were based in India and 10,452 were based in the rest of the world.[120] In the
        same period, the rate of attrition was 10.6%.[120] The average age of a TCS employee is 28 years.[120] The
        employee utilisation rate, excluding trainees, for the FY 2012–13 was 82%.[120] TCS was the fifth-largest United
        States visa recipient in 2008 (after Infosys, CTS, Wipro, and Mahindra Satyam).[127][128][129] In 2012, the Tata
        Group companies, including TCS, were the second-largest recipient of H-1B visas.[130][131] As of Jan 2020, TCS
        has over 4,00,000+ employees. It is the world's third-largest IT employer behind IBM and HP.</b></i></p>
